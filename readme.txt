To import your PHP project into XAMPP, 
first, ensure you have XAMPP installed (https://www.apachefriends.org/) 
and PHP & MySQL are enabled in XAMPP.

Then, copy your entire PHP project folder (e.g., qcunnected) 
into the htdocs folder within your XAMPP directory 
(usually located at C:\xampp\htdocs). 
The project should be placed in this path:
C:\xampp\htdocs\qcunnected\.

After that, open the XAMPP Control Panel and start both Apache and MySQL services by clicking Start next to each service. Once the services are running (indicated by green), open phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.

Next, create a new database by clicking the Databases tab, entering the desired name for your database (qcunnected), and clicking Create.

Once the database is created, click on the database name from the left panel, then go to the Import tab. Click Choose File, select your .sql file (usually located inside a database folder in your project), and click Go to import the database. If the import is successful, you should see a confirmation message.

After importing the database, configure the database connection in your PHP project by locating your config.php (or similar) file. Ensure the database credentials in the configuration match your XAMPP settings, which are usually localhost for the server, root for the username, and an empty password ('' by default in XAMPP). For example:
